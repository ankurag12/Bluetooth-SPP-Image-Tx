Modified the Bluetooth-SPP-Terminal app by Alexander (https://github.com/Sash0k/bluetooth-spp-terminal) .
The original app sends/recevies strings over Bluetooth. 
This modified version is used to transmit images to an Electronic Paper Display setup, the firmware for which is at https://github.com/ankurag12/Electronic-Paper-Display-Bluetooth
It uses a customized protocol for breaking down image to chunks of data, so it is not a generic app to transmit images over Bluetooth.
This was done because of the hardware limitation at the receiving end - It uses an MSP430 controller which cannot handle big files.
